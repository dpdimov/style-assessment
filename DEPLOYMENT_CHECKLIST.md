# Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Ready for Vercel Deployment

### What's Changed
- ✅ **Multi-assessment architecture implemented**
- ✅ **Database schema updated** (assessment_id column added)
- ✅ **Assessment selection screen** added before main UI
- ✅ **Configuration loading** updated for assessment-specific configs
- ✅ **Debug logs removed** from production code
- ✅ **Build tests passed** successfully

### Database Migration Required
⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The production database needs the assessment_id column added.

**Run this SQL in your production database (Neon):**

```sql
-- Add the assessment_id column
ALTER TABLE assessment_results 
ADD COLUMN assessment_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default';

-- Add indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_assessment_id ON assessment_results(assessment_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_assessment_custom ON assessment_results(assessment_id, custom_code);

-- Update analytics view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS assessment_analytics;
CREATE VIEW assessment_analytics AS
SELECT 
  assessment_id,
  custom_code,
  email_domain,
  COUNT(*) as total_assessments,
  AVG(x_coordinate) as avg_x,
  AVG(y_coordinate) as avg_y,
  MIN(completed_at) as first_assessment,
  MAX(completed_at) as last_assessment
FROM assessment_results
WHERE custom_code IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY assessment_id, custom_code, email_domain
ORDER BY total_assessments DESC;
```

### Deployment Steps

1. **Run Database Migration** (above SQL in Neon console)

2. **Deploy to Vercel** (automatic on git push):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Multi-assessment architecture - production ready"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - ✅ Assessment selection screen appears first
   - ✅ Kinetic Thinking Assessment works end-to-end
   - ✅ Results display correctly
   - ✅ Database saves with assessment_id

### Key Features Now Available

- 🎯 **Multi-assessment support** - Easy to add new assessment types
- 🎨 **Assessment-specific branding** - Each assessment has its own UI text and styling
- 📊 **Assessment tracking** - Database tracks which assessment type was taken
- 🔧 **Easy configuration** - JSON-based assessment configuration
- 📱 **Mobile-friendly** - Assessment selection and flow work on all devices

### Post-Deployment

- **Test the live application** with the Kinetic Thinking Assessment
- **Monitor logs** in Vercel dashboard for any issues
- **Check database** to confirm assessment_id is being saved correctly
